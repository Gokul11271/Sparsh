## Cloudinary Integration

- Upload: `/api/gallery/upload` accepts multipart/form-data, validates file types, and uploads to Cloudinary.
- Transformation: Images/videos are auto-optimized for device and bandwidth.
- Delivery: Gallery fetches CDN URLs for fast, global access.
- Deletion: Securely removes media from both Cloudinary and MongoDB.

---

## MongoDB Real-Time Updates

- Change Streams: Listens for insert/update/delete on content and gallery collections.
- WebSockets: Pushes updates to connected clients (users/admins) instantly.
- Use Cases: Live notifications, gallery refresh, admin alerts.

---

## Security & Best Practices

- Environment Variables: Sensitive data managed via `.env` files.
- Input Validation: Server-side and client-side validation for all endpoints.
- Rate Limiting: Prevents brute-force and abuse.
- CORS & Helmet: Secures HTTP headers and cross-origin requests.
- Password Hashing: Uses bcrypt for storing credentials.
- Logging & Monitoring: Centralized error logging and health checks.
